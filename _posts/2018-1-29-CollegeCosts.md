title: What is Driving College Costs Higher?
---

Over the past 30 years, college costs have been rising exponentially, and the increase has been especially clear when
compared against the increase in income over the same period of time. So I decided to see if I could analyze whether there
were certain attributes of these colleges that were driving the cost of tuition.

I decided to scrape data from [CollegeData.com](https://www.collegedata.com/), which is a website that mainly acts 
as an online college advisor for prospective students. For each college page, they have information on admissions, financial aid,
academics, campus life etc.
