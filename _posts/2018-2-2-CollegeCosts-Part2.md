title: What is Driving College Costs Higher? Part 2 - Data Exploration and Analysis

This is a continuation of my last blog post, which can be found [here](https://kstern31.github.io/CollegeCosts-Part1/).

## Data Exploration ##
Since this was a linear regression analysis, one of the assumptions is to make sure that the dependent variable is normally
distributed. If it isn't, a non-linear transformation might be necessary. As can be seen from the distribution plot below,
the dependent variable (total cost of tuition) is fairly normally distributed, so we won't perform any transforms on it.
